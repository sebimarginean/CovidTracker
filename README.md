# COVID-19 Tracker Web Application

## Overview

This COVID-19 Tracker is a web application designed to provide real-time statistics and visualizations of the COVID-19 pandemic globally. It is built with React for the frontend to ensure a dynamic and responsive user interface, and Node.js for backend services, including API data fetching and processing.

## Technical Features

- **Real-Time API Integration**: Uses asynchronous JavaScript (via `async/await`) to fetch the latest COVID-19 data from public health APIs such as [Disease.sh](https://disease.sh/). The application periodically updates its data to reflect the most current statistics.
- **React-Based UI**: Leverages React's component-based architecture for efficient UI rendering and state management. React Router is used for navigational components, enabling a single-page application (SPA) experience.
- **Data Visualization**: Implements libraries such as Chart.js and Leaflet for rendering interactive charts and maps, enhancing data comprehension through visual means.
- **Responsive Web Design**: Utilizes CSS Flexbox and Grid along with media queries to achieve a responsive layout that adapts to various screen sizes and devices.

## Project Structure

- **`src/`**:
  - **Components**: Reusable React components for UI elements such as charts, maps, and data tables.
  - **Hooks**: Custom React hooks for managing state and side effects related to API data fetching.
  - **Utilities**: Helper functions and services for data processing and API interaction.
- **`public/`**: Contains the `index.html` file serving as the app's entry point, along with static assets like images and icons.
- **`package.json` & `package-lock.json`**: List project dependencies, scripts, and other configurations. Dependency management follows semantic versioning.
